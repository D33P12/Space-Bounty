Space Bounty 
GDD

Base controller : wasd, mouse delta, Lshift
Objective: hunt and destroy bounty (in space)

might create a range in which obstacle will spawn
need to figure out how to create nav mesh trail for enemy ai
going to use state machine for ai (ill try)
abstract would be good for collectables (refuel and points)
after moving in a specific direction for some time will spawn bounty and pirate gaurds around it (random)
might create different hitboxes for player damage 

collectables : for now its a cube

could create a black hole (i could make a collider for range and when the player is in the collider it will disable the input and 
would pull the player at a the center(empty game object) then game over 

for wrap points( i could use two points for transform position of player from 1 to another add effects to it (time wrap)

yeah i am gonna cut alot of things from this gdd

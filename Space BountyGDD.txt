Space Bounty 
GDD

Base controller : wasd, mouse, Lshift
Objective: hunt and destroy bounty (in space)

might create a range in which obstacle will spawn

to add anxiety in the game 
i am going to add color change of the enemy and depending on 
what color it has when you shoot the enemy will decide weather its
rewarding or not. the color change will be random , example 
if the player the enemy when its red then you get 10point 
when purple the -10point yellow -10 health to the player, etc....

going to show which color 
probably going to add 2 types of empty game objects 
1.for spawning enemies
2.petrol points for the spawned enemies 

going add wave system so the player has some time to breath between waves.
